### Option 2: Deploy via Drag & Drop (3 min)

## DNS Configuration (Once Site is Deployed)

### Option A: Nameservers (Easiest)

**Vercel:**
1. Copy nameservers from Vercel (they'll provide them)
2. Go to your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
3. Replace existing nameservers with Vercel's nameservers
4. Save changes
5. Wait 24-48 hours

**Netlify:**
1. Similar to Vercel - use Netlify's nameservers

### Option B: DNS Records (Manual)

**For Vercel:**

Add these records at your domain registrar:

```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 76.76.21.21
TTL: 3600

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
TTL: 3600
```

**For Netlify:**

Check Netlify dashboard for specific DNS values.

## First-Time Setup After Deploy

### 1. Configure Analytics (5 min)

**Get Google Analytics ID:**
1. Go to https://analytics.google.com
2. Create new property: "Bail Bond Buddy"
3. Get Measurement ID (looks like `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)

**Add to your site:**
1. Open `/utils/analytics.ts` in your code
2. Line 12: Replace `'YOUR_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID'` with your actual ID
3. Commit and push changes (or redeploy)

### 2. Test Everything (10 min)

Visit your live site and test:
- [ ] All pages load correctly
- [ ] Navigation works
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Contact form sends email
- [ ] Cookie banner appears
- [ ] All links work

### 3. Submit to Google (5 min)

1. Go to https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Add property: `bailbondbuddy.com`
3. Verify ownership (DNS or HTML file)
4. Done! Google will start indexing your site

## Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### Site shows blank page
**Fix:** Check browser console (F12) for errors. Usually a missing file or import issue.

### Contact form doesn't work
**Fix:** Form only works on the deployed site, not localhost. Web3Forms key is already configured.

### 404 on page refresh
**Fix:** Already configured in `vercel.json` and `netlify.toml`. If using other hosting, add redirect rules.

### Images not loading
**Fix:** Check that images are in the `dist` folder after build. All image paths should be relative.

### DNS not working
**Fix:** DNS propagation takes 24-48 hours. Check progress at https://dnschecker.org
