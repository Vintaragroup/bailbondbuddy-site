## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
**Check:** Node version (should be 18+)  
**Fix:** Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies installed

### Blank Page After Deploy
**Check:** Browser console (F12) for errors  
**Fix:** Usually a missing dependency or import path issue

### Contact Form Not Sending
**Check:** Are you on the live site (not localhost)?  
**Check:** Is Web3Forms key correct in `/components/ContactPage.tsx`?  
**Note:** Key is already configured - should work immediately

### DNS Not Propagating
**Wait:** 24-48 hours is normal  
**Check:** https://dnschecker.org to monitor progress  
**Verify:** Correct nameservers or A/CNAME records entered

### Analytics Not Tracking
**Check:** GA4 Measurement ID added to `/utils/analytics.ts`?  
**Check:** Not on localhost (analytics disabled locally)  
**Check:** Browser console for "[Analytics] Initialized" message
